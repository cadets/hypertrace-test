;;
;; A function implementing a simple EDSL for test specification. Error reporting
;; could be vastly improved, but for now this is sensible enough for us to start
;; specifying tests.
;;
;; Example:
;;
;; (mk-hypertrace-test
;;  '((name "test-interesting-stuff")
;;    (in-file "/path/to/in-file")
;;    (expected-out "/path/to/expected-out")
;;    (cmp-method 'some-function)
;;    (run-method 'separate-process)))
;;
;;
;; This function can return two things:
;;   (1) A runnable test;
;;   (2) A list of two things (#f err-msg).
;;
;; The caller should take care to check these values, however if the error is
;; not handled and only the internal procedures are used to manipulate the test,
;; things will continue to behave correctly and propagate the error gracefully.
